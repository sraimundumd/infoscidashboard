##### Information problem you're trying to solve
    How can we make finding classes easier for Information Science Students? 
    Testudo is a great platform, however in order to get there and then filter by department, course, etc it takes a very long time 
    We want to be able to help students easily navigate through a web page and retrieve the exact information they are looking for
##### Stakeholders/target browsers:
    Information Science Students, current and former 
    Incoming Information Science Students 
##### Data you chose to work with
    Information Science class schedule per semester to determine how students should build their schedule.
##### Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem
    We chose to address this problem by asking ourselves what we, as information science students, would have found helpful to make our schedules prior to this course. We decided on making an application that will search for only Information Science classes throughout semesters and provide information on those courses.
##### Technical system decision rationale

##### How/if your final system helps to address the problem
    Our final system well impacts our original problem by actually making it easier to see only InfoSci classes previous models the university has put in place can only section off core classes but not major classes alike. What we have been able to accomplish is singling out infosci classes to allow for better schedule planning. 
##### Challenges faced and impact on final design
    Challenges we faced were connecting to the API and trying to ensure our layout was nice. Once we got the API to function and return the information, we asked for the information would come back as a jumbled result and contain information from one semester only. In the end we had it so that the information will be able properly spaced and provide accurate results.
##### Possible future work directions with this problem
* Gather more data on classes (building, reviews, etc.)
* Able to easily pull previous semester information instead of having to query using Axios 
* Gather user data and actually allowing students to plan out schedule
* Show information on professors and advisors (sections, reviews, etc.)
